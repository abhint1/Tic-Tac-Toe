# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Hints

Welcome to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players can compete against each other with a twist - the game provides hints using the powerful Minimax algorithm. This ensures that every move you make is well-thought-out and strategic!

## Game Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Both players can enjoy a seamless and competitive experience.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The game uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to provide hints for each move, ensuring optimal play.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-understand text-based interface that clearly displays the game board and prompts for player moves.
- **Win/Tie Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script to begin playing.
2. **Player Moves**: Players take turns entering their moves. Each move consists of a row and column number (e.g., `1 1` for the center cell).
3. **Hint System**: After each move, the game provides a hint for the current player using the Minimax algorithm, helping you make the best possible move.
4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. **Tie Condition**: If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
